Hey Professor Haaf,

I added the database as per your instructions~ Because of the formatting, it would've been 2 pages for not much content. I imagine preferably it be kept to one page. As such, I included both the unmarked and marked versions as a single PDF (2 pages total) and I included the excel spreadsheet folder in case you wanted easier viewing.

Also I'm not sure but I don't think you were the one that wanted a storyboard for the demo reel? I asked Professor Bennett and he said no and that it might be you. Then I contacted you to ask if all you wanted was just the github link and database pdf (and mySQL file but you said no to that) and there was no mention of a storyboard when I did. (I was sick when I contacted you so my phrasing was different because different mindset at the time). I asked Professor Deluca in class and he didn't want a storyboard either.
If you did want a storyboard, I will be more than happy to provide one, but I'm presently acting under the assumption you didn't want one.

Also one final note; I do appreciate yours and Professor Bennett's feedback about the website layout~ I did make a few changes but unfortunately, I did not take one (the index buttons) as I couldn't get a result I liked. At the end of the day, this may be the website that I'll be taking with me out of college so I want to make sure it can be something I live with :) I don't think you'll be seeing it (possibly?) in the submission but I did want to mention because I did want to acknowledge your feedback even though I didn't assimilate it.

Sincerely,
Dan

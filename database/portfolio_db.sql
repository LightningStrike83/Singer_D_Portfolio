As I was thinking of projects, I realized the Pok√©mon community doesn\'t have a \"Create Your Own Pokedex\" which I was surprised at. So, like Thanos from Avengers, I said \"Fine, I\'ll do it myself.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought it would be simple, using the tools I learned from class. However, I quickly found out that I was taking on a little more than I could chew at the time. I had the right ideas, just the wrong executions. I needed to get a bit of external help in order to accomplish the task at hand.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOne thing that struck my mind as I was working was \"There are a lot of Pokemon; scrolling is going to take forever and be bad UX/UI\". So I stopped and thought, and created a menu and some javascript that, when a region is interacted with, it will hide all the Pokemon from all the other regions.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd then I realized too, if someone wants all of the regions on at once, I would need to include an \"All\" button for better functionality.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge to figure out was how to return the Pok√©mon models to their proper home if they were no longer desired. I managed to write code that could bring it back to the right area of the page, but not its original box.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThen it struck me; I could give its original home and the asset a timestamp. Then, when the model is dropped back into the model area, the system will look for a matching timestamp and append the image to its original area automatically.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEventually, with hard work and persistence, the Create Your Own Pokedex website finally finished with the best functionality I could give it!', 'project1a.svg'),
